        Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software. Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent
        of hardware and makes computers programmable. There are three basic types: System software to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities. Programming software
        to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other tools to create code. Application software (applications or apps) to help users perform tasks. Office productivity suites, data management software, media
        players and security programs are examples. Applications also refers to web and mobile applications like those used to shop on Amazon.com, socialize with Facebook or post pictures to Instagram.1 A possible fourth type is embedded software. Embedded
        systems software is used to control machines and devices not typically considered computers — telecommunications networks, cars, industrial robots and more. These devices, and their software, can be connected as part of the Internet of Things
        (IoT).2 Software development is primarily conducted by programmers, software engineers and software developers. These roles interact and overlap, and the dynamics between them vary greatly across development departments and communities. Programmers,
        or coders, write source code to program computers for specific tasks like merging databases, processing online orders, routing communications, conducting searches or displaying text and graphics. Programmers typically interpret instructions from
        software developers and engineers and use programming languages like C++ or Java to carry them out.
